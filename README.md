<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Code

Implemented a few examples demonstrating the usage of assembly language to solve problems.

The intention of sharing the code is to help beginners like me to get started with assembly language and to realize that assembly language is **not** difficult. 

### Examples
The examples implemented are:
* Finding the k-th largest value in an array
* Finding the modulus of a number w.r.t another number
* Computing the gcd of two numbers

### Built With

Code is in assembly (with .s extension).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Qtspim Simulator](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)
SPIM is a software simulator, designed to run programs for MIPS processors. The newest version of Spim is called QtSpim, and unlike all of the other versions, it runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linuxâ€”the same source code and the same user interface on all three platforms!

* Windows Users:
    * Download QtSpim_9.1.21_Windows.msi from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/).
    * Install the package and then run.
    * Open any of the example files. Always use the Reinitialize and Load file option.
    * Run the program by clicking on the Run button.

* Mac Users:
    * Download QtSpim_9.1.21_mac.pkg from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/).
    * Since this is from a developer not identified by Apple, you would be required to refer to [this link](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) which tells you how to install such programs.
        * You basically have to Control-click the pkg file for it to run installation
    * Open any of the example files. Always use the Reinitialize and Load file option.
    * Run the program by clicking on the Run button.

* Linux Users:
    * Download qtspim_9.1.21.1_linux64.deb from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/).
    * Install the package and then run.
    * Open any of the example files. Always use the Reinitialize and Load file option.
    * Run the program by clicking on the Run button.
